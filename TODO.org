Greylost TODO

* DONE get basic PoC working
  CLOSED: [2019-11-24 Sun 19:51]
* DONE timestamps
  CLOSED: [2019-11-26 Tue 08:04]
* DONE sort responses before adding to bloom filter
  CLOSED: [2019-11-26 Tue 15:26]
queries with multiple responses arent guaranteed to be in the same
order each time they are queried. These should be sorted prior to
adding to the bloom filter so that they arent counted dozens of times
due to being out of order
* TODO logging
* TODO HUP signal reopens log files.
* TODO daemonize
* TODO ignore list for bloom filter
mcafee is making a ton of random resolutions. we know that this
particular case is benign, so add some feature to ignore these
queries.
* TODO argparse for interface, promisc, etc
* TODO discover interface or default to "any"
* TODO finish IPv6 in pypacket
* TODO baseline timer
don't alert on new queries before N time passes. This allows the
software to baseline DNS queries and not give alerts.
* TODO ability to save/reload filter (for reboots/restarts)
* TODO Splunk/ELK
* TODO detect volume abnormalities
* TODO investigate pypacket alternatives
* TODO offline mode?
This might not work great; dont know if pcaps keep timestamps in a
manner that I can utilize.
