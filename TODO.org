* DONE get basic PoC working
  CLOSED: [2019-11-24 Sun 19:51]
* DONE timestamps
  CLOSED: [2019-11-26 Tue 08:04]
* DONE sort responses before adding to bloom filter
  CLOSED: [2019-11-26 Tue 15:26]
queries with multiple responses arent guaranteed to be in the same
order each time they are queried. These should be sorted prior to
adding to the bloom filter so that they arent counted dozens of times
due to being out of order
* DONE baseline timer
  CLOSED: [2019-11-27 Wed 14:49]
don't alert on new queries before N time passes. This allows the
software to baseline DNS queries and not give alerts.
* DONE argparse for interface, promisc, etc

* TODO ignore list for bloom filter
mcafee is making a ton of random resolutions. we know that this
particular case is benign, so add some feature to ignore these
queries.
* TODO Alerting for resolutions of known-bad domains
Splunk/Discord webhook alerts if some booger eater tries to resolve
http.kali.org
* TODO shared bloom filter when using multiple resolvers
this will be another project, but has other potential use cases.

example HTTP API:
/add?filter=name_here&element=element_goes_here
/lookup?filter=name_here&element=element_goes_here

add a flag to use remote endpoint rather than local filter.
* TODO add malicious domains to blocklist when using w/ dnsmasq
* TODO ability to save/reload filter (for reboots/restarts)
* TODO Splunk/ELK
Add examples of how to ingest this data. Don't really have to add any
code for this...
* TODO detect dns protocol abuses
- weird TXT/NULL records
- hex/baseN encoded stuff: aabbccddeeff.whatever.com
- volume
- not dns at all.. they are just sending data over port 53
* TODO add mmh3 to requirements.txt
This should speed it up a bit
* TODO setup.py
* TODO offline mode?
This might not work great; dont know if pcaps keep timestamps in a
manner that I can utilize.
