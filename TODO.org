* TODO argparse for interface, promisc, etc
* TODO discover interface or default to "any"

don't alert on new queries before N time passes. This allows the
software to baseline DNS queries and not give alerts.
* TODO ability to save/reload filter (for reboots/restarts)
* TODO Splunk/ELK
* TODO detect volume abnormalities
* TODO investigate pypacket alternatives
* TODO offline mode?
This might not work great; dont know if pcaps keep timestamps in a
